For storing messages and authors in the database with API, just make a post call at route '/api/store' with params 'name', and 'body'.

To see messages from the database check the route '/messages' who have an optional id parameter.

The time to complete the test was 1 hour, I tried a variant with a small number of lines of code and as clear as possible, I did not understand if the authors and messages should be stored separately (routes) or at the same time, but I think you can see that it is not a technical problem to stay
